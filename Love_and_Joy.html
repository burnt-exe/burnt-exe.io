        <h1>Love and Joy: A Delicate Balance</h1>
        <p>In his early thirties, a young man stood</p>
        <p>Looking for love, like so many would</p>
        <p>He searched high and low, both far and wide</p>
        <p>But no joy within him, he could find</p>
        <p>He thought that love would fill the void</p>
        <p>And bring him happiness, he'd always avoid</p>
        <p>The truth that joy must come from within</p>
        <p>For love alone, is not enough to win</p>
        <p>He met many people, both kind and true</p>
        <p>But none of them brought him joy anew</p>
        <p>He realized, with a heavy heart</p>
        <p>That searching for love, was tearing him apart</p>
        <p>So he began a journey of self-discovery</p>
        <p>To find happiness within, was his discovery</p>
        <p>He found passions, hobbies, and dreams</p>
        <p>And learned to love himself, or so it seems</p>
        <p>Now he's a man who's content and happy</p>
        <p>No longer searching, he's free and snappy</p>
        <p>For he knows that joy must come from within</p>
        <p>And love will come, when he least expects it to begin</p>
        <p>So to those who seek love, he has this to say</p>
        <p>Look within yourself, find joy today</p>
        <p>For love alone, can never be enough</p>
        <p>Without joy from within, life is tough</p>
