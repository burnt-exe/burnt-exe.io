          <h2>To Make You Smile and Cry</h2>
          <p>
            The sky is painted in hues of dawn, <br />
            A canvas where the stars have just withdrawn. <br />
            In the stillness, your strength emerges bright, <br />
            A beacon of hope in the soft morning light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your journey, Miss Stewart, is a tale of grace, <br />
            With every step, a new dawn you embrace. <br />
            In Juke's eyes, your reflection does gleam, <br />
            A hero's heart in a young child's dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the storms, your spirit remains bold, <br />
            A story of love and courage to be told. <br />
            In your unwavering love, a world does unfold, <br />
            Where dreams take flight and hearts are consoled.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are the melody in a symphony's rise, <br />
            A testament to the strength in your eyes. <br />
            Your love, a river that endlessly flows, <br />
            In Juke's life, your legacy grows.
          </p>
          <p>
            So when the nights are long, and the road seems tough, <br />
            Remember, dear heart, you are enough. <br />
            With every dawn, a new hope will arise, <br />
            In the love that you share, in the light of your eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With love and appreciation, <br />
            <strong>Mr. Matthee</strong>
